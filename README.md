This repo is for the GNU Radio assignment. Two grc files are the tested block diagram for DVB-T and FM bands and the pdf file is the final report.

This energy detector doesn't work well when it is applied to the FM band and the problem is explained in the report. However, I failed to figure out the reason and improve the current block diagram for it. It will be appreciated if you could give me the answer.
